#%%dist		%{expand:%%{?_with_sles:.sles}%%{!?_with_sles:%%{default_dist}}}
#
# Raw vendor/distribution strings (with no dots).
#
%ubuntu_string	ubuntu
%el5_string	el5
%el6_string	el6
#
# Used  in  the  package  name, typically as part of the  release
# identifier...
# ubuntu: no dot prepended (as per their documented naming spec).
# el5, el6, sles: must have a dot prepended.
#
# Typical usage example in the spec file:
# Release: 01%{?dist}
#
# To pass this in from rpmbuild:
# rpmbuild --with ubuntu ...
# rpmbuild --with el5 ...
#
# Starting  with EL6 (and SLES in general), %dist is defined,  so
# the  following  should be disabled  if building on an operating
# system newer than EL6 or on SLES. For details, refer to:
#
# https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=613985
# http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHEA-2011-0985.html
#
# in  fact, using "BuildRequires: buildsys-macros" as  documented
# in the bug report and the errata might be a better solution.

#
# Same string, always with dots prepended, useful for naming in-
# clude  files  and  source files. It is OK for this macro to be
# blank to support older packages.
#
# Typical usage example:
# Source0: barfo_post%{rtp_dist}.sh   (will expand to barfo_post.ubuntu.sh)
