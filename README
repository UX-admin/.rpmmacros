NAME
       rpmmacros  -  macro  definitions	 for  building	runtime	 platform  RPM
       packages


DESCRIPTION
       In addition to being  compiled  to  build  packages  in	the  /usr/src/
       directory,  the	redhat	package	 manager also reads /etc/rpmmacros and
       $HOME/.rpmmacros file, and will override, as well as  augment  built-in
       macro definitions with the ones found in the above files.

       This  repository	 contains the macro overrides of the rpm built-ins, as
       well as additional macro definitions  required  to  build  all  runtime
       platform RPM packages with the rpmbuild(1) command. The .rpmmacros file
       can be copied either to one's  home,  or	 to  the  /etc/	 directory  as
       /etc/rpmmacros.
